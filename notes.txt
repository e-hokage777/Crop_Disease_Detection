- There are hardly any overlaps so make box_nms_thresh really low
-- MAKE SURE TO PERFORM MEAN NORMALIZATION (Images are really green so might be very important !!!!!!!!!!!)
-- SOME CLASSES LIKE "Corn_Cercospora_Leaf_Spot" and "Corn_Streak" are very similar (If I remove corn_streak my model might do better since there are more of the other)



INSIGHTS::::::::::::
-- coninciding bounding boxes with different classes. usually between tomato and pepper diseases
-- from research pepper doesn't have Septoria, probably reason for duplicate
-- Peppers were mistake for tomatoes in blightn and septoria
